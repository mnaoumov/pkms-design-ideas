# Main hierarchy

In order to put one note into multiple hierarchies, you define a main hierarchy first and put the content there

[Main hierarchy/Note](<./Main hierarchy/Note.md>)

Then you put a link to it in another hierarchy, to avoid duplication.

[Another hierarchy/Note](<./Another hierarchy/Note.md>)

Potentially, eventually another hierarchy note can evolve independently if it has content that is not applicable to the main hierarchy.

Or maybe, eventually the note hierarchies change their roles and another one becomes a main one and vice versa.
